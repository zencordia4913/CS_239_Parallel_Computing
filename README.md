### Parallel Metaheuristic Algorithms for Hyperparameter Search in Logistic Regression

#### ðŸ“„ `SALAS_CS239_FINAL_PROJECT_PAPER.pdf`

**Objective:**  
Use parallel population-based and local search metaheuristic algorithms to find optimal hyperparameters for small machine learning models like **logistic reggression** vs. traditional seuential brute-force methods comparing their optimization effectiveness and computational efficiency.

#### Implemented Algorithms:
| Algorithm                      | File                |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Genetic Algorithm (GA)        | `GA_LR_MSR.py`      |
| Improved GA                   | `GA_LR_MSR2.py`     |
| Simulated Annealing (SA)      | `SA_LR.py`          |
| Tabu Search (TS)              | `TS_LR.py`          |
| Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) | `ACO_LR.py`         |
| Particle Swarm Optimization   | `PSO_LR.py`         |
| Variable Neighborhood Search  | `VNS_LR.py`         |
| Baseline (Sequential)         | `SEQ_LR.py`         |

#### ðŸ§¾ Objective:
- Optimize Logistic Regression's Hyperparameters: Regularization parameter C, Penalty mode, Learning rate, and Solver type through parallel metaheuristics 
- Evaluation metrics: **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **computation time**
- Tools: Python, matplotlib, `numpy`, `random`, `math`, PyCUDA

**Summary of Findings:**
- Parallel metaheuristics effectively found near-optimal hyperparameters.
- GA variants and PSO produced the best balance between error minimization and runtime.
- Parallel metaheuristic solvers are more time efficient than sequential-brute force methods.
- All results logged in `PROJECT_RESULTS.xlsx`.
